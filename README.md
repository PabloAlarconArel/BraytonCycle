# Brayton Cycle
### Description

The Regenerative Brayton Cycle project is a program that illustrates, through a T-s diagram, the performance of gas turbine and jet engine operations.
It also includes temperature data and regenerator effectiveness analysis, allowing the user to obtain important parameters such as specific enthalpy, ideal efficiency, ideal heat input, and ideal work output.

What is it for?

- It represents an improvement to gas turbine systems, aimed at reducing energy losses in the cycle.
- This improvement contributes to fuel economy by lowering the required heat input.
- It is effective only when the turbine exhaust temperature is higher than the compressor outlet temperature.
